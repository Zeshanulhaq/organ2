</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become">There is no age limit for becoming an organ donor. 
</p>

</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become">Can you become an organ donor if you have a medical condition?
</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become">Having an illness or medical condition doesn't necessarily prevent a person from becoming an organ or tissue donor</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become">. The decision about whether some or all organs or tissue are suitable for transplant is made by medical specialists</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become"> at the time of donation, taking into account your medical, travel and social history. 
</p>
        				
        				<p class="who-can-become">There are very few conditions where organ donation is ruled out completely. 
</p>
        				
        				<p class="who-can-become">A person cannot become an organ donor if they have or are suspected of having:
</p>
        				
        				<p class="who-can-become">Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)
</p>

</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become">*In rare cases, the organs of donors with HIV have been used to help others with the same conditions. If you live</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become"> with HIV and wish to be a donor, please register to donate, the medical team will establish whether or not your</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become"> organs are suitable for donation.
</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become">Screening
</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become">Blood is taken from all potential donors and tested to rule out transmissible diseases and viruses such as HIV and</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become"> hepatitis. The family of the potential donor is made aware that this procedure is required.
</p>
        			
        				<p class="who-can-become">Can you become an organ donor if you have had cancer?
</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become">Someone with current active cancer cannot become an organ donor. However, it may be possible for people with</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become"> certain types of cancers to donate after three years of treatment. It may also be possible to donate corneas and</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become"> some tissue in these circumstances.

        				<p class="who-can-become">Lifestyle choices
</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become">Can you become an organ donor if you smoke?
</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become">It is still possible to become an organ donor if you smoke. Specialist healthcare professionals decide in each</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become"> individual case whether a person's organs and tissue are suitable for donation, and smokers and people with</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become"> other health conditions have saved - and continue to save - lives through organ donation. 
</p>
        				
        				<p class="who-can-become">Can you become an organ donor if you have a tattoo?
</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become">Having a tattoo does not prevent you from becoming an organ donor. 
</p>
        				
        				<p class="who-can-become">Can you become an organ donor if you drink alcohol?
</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become">Drinking alcohol does not prevent you from becoming an organ donor. Although a heavy alcohol intake might</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become"> affect your ability to donate some organs, specialist healthcare professionals will decide which organs and tissue</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become"> are suitable for donation on an individual basis.
</p>
        				
        				<p class="who-can-become">Ethnicity
</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become">Does race, or ethnicity matter in organ donation?
</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become">We need donors from all communities and ethnicities.
</p>
        				
        				<p class="who-can-become">Blood and tissue types need to match for a transplant to be successful, and organs from donors of the same ethnic</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become"> background as the recipient are more likely to be a close match. 
</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become">Non-blood donors
</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become">Can you become an organ donor if you are unable to donate blood?
</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become">If you don’t or can’t give blood you can still be a potential organ donor.
</p>
           				<p class="who-can-become">There may be specific reasons why it has not been possible to donate blood such as having had a blood transfusion</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become"> (or blood products) since 1 January 1980. Or there may be reasons why you could not give blood because of your</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become"> health at the time. Sometimes a simple thing like a cold or medication that you are taking can prevent you from</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become"> donating blood.
</p>
        				
        				<p class="who-can-become">The decision about whether some or all organs or tissue are suitable for transplant is always made by a medical</p>
        				<p class="who-can-become"> specialist at the time of donation, taking into account your medical history.
